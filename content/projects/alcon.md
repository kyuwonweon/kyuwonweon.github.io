## Project Overview

As a Medical Device Design Engineer at **Alcon** for three years, I managed the lifecycle of next-generation intraocular lens delivery systems. My role bridged the gap between rapid iterative design and rigorous quality engineering, ensuring devices met strict FDA standards through data-driven validation.

## Technical Contributions

### 1. Rapid Prototyping & DFM
Accelerated the hardware development cycle using **PTC Creo** for mechanical design and 3D printing for immediate validation.
* Transformed functional prototypes into mass-producible designs by performing **Design for Manufacturing (DFM)** analysis.
* Collaborated directly with injection molding vendors to optimize tool design, ensuring complex geometries could be molded consistently at scale.

### 2. Statistical Analysis & Validation
Moved beyond "pass/fail" testing by implementing rigorous statistical quality control using **Minitab**:
* Defined delivery testing requests and executed **hypothesis testing** (e.g., 2-sample % defective tests) to validate design changes against legacy standards.
* Utilized statistical models to analyze failure rates, ensuring the final product met Six Sigma reliability requirements before transfer to manufacturing.

### 3. Human-Centered Design
Organized and led feedback sessions with ophthalmic surgeons to refine device ergonomics.
* Translated qualitative feedback from wet labs into quantitative engineering requirements.
* Balanced user needs (tactile feel, ease of use) with strict mechanical tolerances required for the intraocular lens protection.

## Relevance to Robotics
This experience honed my ability to validate complex systems using data. In robotics, "making it move" is only the first step; ensuring it performs robustly under uncertainty is the real challenge. My background in statistical validation and DFM allows me to approach robotics not just as a coder, but as an engineer who understands system reliability and physical hardware constraints.
