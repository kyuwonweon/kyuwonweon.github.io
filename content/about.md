Hello! I am a Master’s candidate in Robotics at Northwestern University, specializing in Motion Planning, Controls, Product Design and Embedded Systems.

Previously, I spent 3 years as an R&D Engineer at Alcon, where I designed and validated safety-critical medical devices for mass production. This experience gave me a rigorous engineering foundation, specifically in validation, reliability, and bridging the sim-to-real gap.

I have since pivoted to robotics, applying that engineering rigor to autonomous systems. My current focus areas include: * System Integration: Integrating vision (RealSense), planning (MoveIt), and control on Franka and PincherX platforms. * Robotics Software: Developing modular, testable nodes in Python within the ROS2 ecosystem. * Simulation & Design: Validating in Gazebo/CoppeliaSim and designing hardware in 3D CAD.

I am seeking Summer 2026 internships in Robotics, Autonomy, or R&D Engineering.
