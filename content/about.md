## The Short Story
I am a **Robotics Engineer** with a background in **R&D & Mechanical Design**. After 3 years of designing medical devices in a strictly regulated environment, I transitioned to robotics to apply that same engineering rigor to autonomous systems.

Currently, I am an MSR (Master of Science in Robotics) candidate at **Northwestern University**, focusing on **manipulation, controls, and dynamic simulation**.

## Professional Experience

### **R&D Mechanical Engineer | Alcon**
*(2021 – 2024)*
Prior to robotics, I led mechanical design for next-generation intraocular lenses (IOLs).
* **Precision Micro-Manufacturing:** Spearheaded the DFM (Design for Manufacturing) of micro-molded optical components with sub-micron tolerances.
* **Regulated Engineering:** Managed the full lifecycle of Class III medical devices under strict FDA regulations (failure was not an option).
* **Cross-Functional Leadership:** Bridged the gap between R&D, Quality, and Manufacturing teams to scale prototypes into mass-production ready products.

## Why Robotics?
At Alcon, I learned how to build hardware that *works*. Now, I am learning how to make it *think*.

My goal is to bridge the gap between robust mechanical hardware and intelligent software control. I am specifically interested in **manipulation**—giving robots the dexterity to interact with the world as precisely as a surgeon (or a lens designer) would.
